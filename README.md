# 👋 Hello! I'm Farcaș Alexandru

I'm passionate about application development, databases, cybersecurity, and networking. I enjoy understanding the differences between programming languages and exploring system architecture from multiple angles — from high-level to low-level.

On this profile, you'll find thematic, comparative, and collaborative projects, all reflecting my drive to learn through hands-on building.

## 🛍️ “Store”-Type Projects

I chose to implement the same project — a store system — using various technologies to understand the differences in approach, modeling, and implementation between languages and paradigms.

### 🗃️ Store – Database (SQLite)
Focused mainly on the **client-side**:
- Detailed structure with information about clients, orders, products, and stock
- Advanced queries: JOINs, subqueries, aggregations
- Main goal: exploring relational modeling and efficient data querying

### 🧾 Store – C++
Console-based application:
- Management of products, clients, and shopping carts
- Implementation without STL, using custom data structures
- Objective: understanding memory handling and procedural programming in C++

### ☕ Store – Java
Object-oriented version with graphical interface:
- Well-structured classes for products, clients, and orders
- Intuitive JavaFX interface and full CRUD functionality
- **Uses a separate SQLite database** from the one in the database project, with its own structure and data
- Goal: learning OOP principles and Java integration with local databases

## 🌐 Web Project – Ticket Reservation

A full ticket reservation system built using:
- `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` for the frontend
- `PHP` for backend logic and database communication
- Features like login, ticket display, and booking functionality
- Designed to simulate a real-world, full-stack web application

## 🤖 Autonomous Robot with Raspberry Pi

I developed a **fully autonomous robot** using a Raspberry Pi, integrating multiple technologies for both control and interaction:

- Built with **Flask** to serve a **live video stream** from an onboard camera
- Accepts user input in the form of questions and responds using **prompt-based logic**
- The responses are converted to speech using a **text-to-speech (TTS)** engine and played in real time
- The robot operates independently, capable of autonomous movement, while being accessible through the local network

### 🔧 Technologies Used

- `Python`
- `Flask`
- `React`
- `OpenCV` (for camera handling)
- `Raspberry Pi OS`
- `Socket` / `HTTP` communication

This project merges hardware and software into a practical, interactive system, bridging web, AI prompting, and embedded robotics.


## 🤝 Team Projects (Linux)

### 🛡️ Advanced Backup Menu (Linux)
- Team-built project, a complex script for automated backup
- Includes options for incremental, differential, and restore
- Runs on Linux using bash commands and interactive dialogs

### 💻 Custom Shell (Linux)
- Built from scratch, similar to Bash
- Supports built-in commands, external execution, redirection, and pipes
- Goal: understanding processes, exec system calls, and command parsing in Linux

## 🧠 Interests and Exploration

- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity** – binary exploitation, reverse engineering, PWN
- 🌐 **Networking** – interested in TCP/IP, ARP, OSI model, routing & switching
- 🔍 **Low-level & Debugging** – ELF files, GDB, strace, Wireshark, packet analysis

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Languages: `SQL`, `C++`, `Java`, `Bash`, `Python`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `PHP`
- Databases: `SQLite` (separate files for different projects)
- Operating Systems: `Linux`, `Windows`
- Tools: `SQLiteStudio`, `Code::Blocks`, `Java Eclipse`, `VS Code`, `Wireshark`, `Ghidra`, `pwntools`, `IDA`
